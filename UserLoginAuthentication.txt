To set up user logins for your website hosted on AWS, you can use Amazon Cognito, which is a fully managed authentication service that allows you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web applications quickly and easily.

Here's how you can implement this:

Create a user pool in Amazon Cognito. This will serve as your user directory and handle user authentication.

Set up your Cognito user pool to manage sign-ups and sign-ins. You can customize the sign-up fields, password policies, and multi-factor authentication options.

Integrate Cognito into your web application using the AWS SDK or Amplify library. This will allow you to add sign-up and sign-in functionality to your frontend.

Use Cognito's built-in UI components or create a custom UI for user authentication that matches your website's design.

After successful authentication, Cognito will provide JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that you can use to authorize access to your backend resources.

For accessing user-specific data, you can use the authenticated user's identity to query your database or other data sources, ensuring users only see their own data.

Implement role-based access control using Cognito groups or custom attributes to manage different levels of access for your users.

Use Cognito's advanced security features like adaptive authentication and compromised credential checking to enhance the security of your application.

By using Amazon Cognito, you can quickly implement a secure, scalable, and customizable authentication system for your AWS-hosted website, allowing users to access their specific data views safely and efficiently.
